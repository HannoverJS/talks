## Submitting a Talk

To submit a talk, just [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues/new). We have prepared a template for you and you only have to replace the required fields. If you want to add additional information like a prefered date, just add it as a new comment to your opened issue. After that, we will review your submission and set it as upcoming talk.

###### Notes:
- Before submitting, please make sure that your topic isn't covered yet by someone else in the [**issues**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues).
- If there is already an open issue with your topic as talk idea, please reference that issue in an extra comment.
