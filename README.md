## Submit a Talk

To submit a talk, just [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues/new). We have already prepared a template for you where you only have to replace the required fields. If you need want add additional information like a prefered date, just add it as new comment to your submission. After that, we will review your submission and set it as upcoming talk.
