## Submitting a Talk

To submit a talk, [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues/new). There we have prepared a template which you just need to fill out. After that, we will review your submission and set it as upcoming talk. If you want to add additional information like a preferred date, just add it as a new comment to your opened issue.

###### Notes:
- Before submitting, please make sure that your topic isn't covered yet by someone else in the [**issues**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues).
- If there is already an open issue with your topic as talk idea, please reference that issue in an extra comment.
- A normal talk should not exceed 30 minutes, a lightning talk should be limited to 10 minutes

#### Talk Ideas

Need some talk ideas? We got you covered! Just take a look at the [**issues with a `Talk Idea` label**](https://github.com/HannoverJS/talks/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Talk+Idea%22).
